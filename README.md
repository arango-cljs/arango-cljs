# Forest - a cozy home for (ArangoDB) Foxx applications.

Write scalable, database-ready APIs and apps in Clojurescript with ease.


**This is an alpha release. The API and organizational structure are
subject to change. Comments and contributions are much appreciated.**


# Features

- [x] Interface to Arango collections utilizing Prismatic's excellent
[Schema](https://github.com/Prismatic/schema) library to validate and coerce
between Clojure (in application context) and Javascript (to store in database).

- [x] A [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/)-inspired syntax
to define routes with ease.

- [ ] A simple authentication middleware.

- [ ] Macros to automatically generate both API server/client libraries based on
collection data types' schemas.

Please see [Tutorial](https://github.com/arango-cljs/arango-cljs/wiki/Tutorial), visit [API]()
and have a look at the [sample application](sample-app/dev/app.cljs) for details.
